# Development Log - Void Miner

## Phase 1: Ship Physics & Controls ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** Fully functional ship with physics-based movement

### Completed Features

#### Core Ship System
- **Physics-based movement** - Momentum and inertia system like classic Asteroids
- **Thrust mechanics** - Arrow key controls for rotation and forward thrust
- **Screen wrapping** - Ship reappears on opposite side when leaving boundaries
- **Visual feedback** - Real-time graphics rendering of ship and effects

#### Auto-Stabilization System
- **Automatic braking** - Ship gradually slows when thrust is released
- **Configurable duration** - 1.5 second stabilization period
- **Smart activation** - Only engages when moving faster than 20 units/sec
- **Early termination** - Stops when speed drops below 10 units/sec

#### Visual Effects
- **Ship rendering** - Clean geometric triangle with proper rotation
- **Main thrust flames** - Multi-stream orange exhaust (4px + 2px secondary streams)
- **Stabilizer flames** - Blue RCS thrusters showing reverse thrust direction
- **Visual hierarchy** - Main engine powerful and dramatic, stabilizers precise and subtle

#### Technical Implementation
- **Modular architecture** - Separate config, main game logic, and clean file structure
- **Vector graphics** - All visuals generated programmatically for perfect scaling
- **Mobile-ready** - Touch-optimized scaling and responsive design
- **Debug system** - Real-time display of speed, stabilization status, and timers

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Coordinate System
- Resolved rotation/physics mismatch by aligning visual and physics coordinate systems
- Phaser rotation 0 = pointing right, increases clockwise
- Triangle rendering and thrust vectors now perfectly aligned

#### Auto-Stabilization Physics
- **Activation trigger**: Speed > 20 units, thrust released
- **Force application**: 30% of main engine power in reverse velocity direction
- **Visual representation**: Flames point in movement direction (showing exhaust)

#### Graphics Rendering
- Ship sprite made invisible, all rendering via Phaser Graphics API
- Frame-by-frame clearing and redrawing for smooth animation
- Line thickness hierarchy: Ship (3px), Main thrust (4px), Stabilizers (4px/2px)

### Configuration Settings
All gameplay values centralized in `config.js`:
- Ship acceleration: 200 units/sec²
- Max speed: 300 units/sec
- Rotation speed: 3 radians/sec
- Stabilization power: 30% of main thrust
- Visual sizes and colors fully configurable

### Next Phase Preview
**Phase 2: Asteroid Generation** - Add procedural asteroid fields with collision detection

### Test Results
- ✅ Ship movement feels responsive and intuitive
- ✅ Auto-stabilization provides natural control without removing skill element
- ✅ Visual effects clearly communicate ship state and actions
- ✅ Physics system stable across different speeds and directions
- ✅ Screen wrapping works smoothly in all directions

### Development Notes
- Auto-stabilization could easily be made into an optional upgrade system
- Current physics values provide good balance between control and challenge
- Vector graphics approach scales perfectly and performs well
- Architecture ready for additional game systems (asteroids, mining, upgrades)

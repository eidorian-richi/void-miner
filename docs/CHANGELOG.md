# Development Log - Void Miner

## Phase 1: Ship Physics & Controls ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** [Previous Session]  
**Status:** Fully functional ship with physics-based movement

### Completed Features

#### Core Ship System
- **Physics-based movement** - Momentum and inertia system like classic Asteroids
- **Thrust mechanics** - Arrow key controls for rotation and forward thrust
- **Screen wrapping** - Ship reappears on opposite side when leaving boundaries
- **Visual feedback** - Real-time graphics rendering of ship and effects

#### Auto-Stabilization System
- **Automatic braking** - Ship gradually slows when thrust is released
- **Configurable duration** - 1.5 second stabilization period
- **Smart activation** - Only engages when moving faster than 20 units/sec
- **Early termination** - Stops when speed drops below 10 units/sec

#### Visual Effects
- **Ship rendering** - Clean geometric triangle with proper rotation
- **Main thrust flames** - Multi-stream orange exhaust (4px + 2px secondary streams)
- **Stabilizer flames** - Blue RCS thrusters showing reverse thrust direction
- **Visual hierarchy** - Main engine powerful and dramatic, stabilizers precise and subtle

#### Technical Implementation
- **Modular architecture** - Separate config, main game logic, and clean file structure
- **Vector graphics** - All visuals generated programmatically for perfect scaling
- **Mobile-ready** - Touch-optimized scaling and responsive design
- **Debug system** - Real-time display of speed, stabilization status, and timers

## Phase 2: Asteroid Field Generation ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** [Current Session]  
**Status:** Fully functional procedural asteroid system with material variety

### Completed Features

#### Procedural Asteroid Generation
- **Random polygon creation** - 5-8 sided asteroids with natural irregular shapes
- **Size variation** - Configurable min/max asteroid sizes (20-60 pixels)
- **Smart spawning** - Asteroids generate away from ship starting position
- **Screen wrapping** - Asteroids wrap around screen edges like ship

#### Material System Implementation
- **Iron Asteroids** (60% spawn rate) - Grey basic asteroids
- **Crystal Asteroids** (30% spawn rate) - Cyan with internal crystalline structure lines
- **Gold Asteroids** (9% spawn rate) - Golden with metallic texture dots
- **Energy Cores** (1% spawn rate) - Magenta with animated pulsing glow effects

#### Asteroid Physics & Movement
- **Realistic drift** - Each asteroid has random velocity and direction
- **Gentle rotation** - Natural spinning motion at varying speeds
- **Physics bodies** - Collision-ready sprites for future interaction
- **Configurable behavior** - Speed ranges and movement patterns in config

#### Visual Polish
- **Material-specific effects** - Each asteroid type has unique visual characteristics
- **Line thickness scaling** - Asteroid outline thickness scales with size
- **Animated effects** - Energy cores pulse dynamically
- **Color coding** - Clear visual distinction between material types

### Technical Architecture Updates

#### New Class Structure
- **Asteroid.js** - Complete asteroid entity with rendering, physics, and material effects
- **Modular entity system** - Clean separation in `src/entities/` folder
- **Material configuration** - Centralized material properties in config

#### Enhanced Game Loop
- **Multi-object rendering** - Ship and asteroids drawn in proper layers
- **Performance optimization** - Single graphics context shared efficiently
- **Debug enhancements** - Asteroid count and status monitoring

### Configuration Additions
New asteroid settings added to `config.js`:
- Asteroid size ranges and speed limits
- Material rarity percentages and visual properties
- World generation parameters (initial count, spawn distances)

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Material Rarity System
- Probability-based material selection using cumulative distribution
- Easy to tweak for gameplay balance
- Foundation for future economic/progression systems

#### Procedural Shape Generation
- Random vertex count with controlled variation for natural appearance
- Radius variation per vertex creates organic, non-uniform shapes
- Rotation and size scaling independent for visual variety

#### Performance Considerations
- Single graphics context for all rendering operations
- Efficient screen wrapping with minimal calculations
- Frame-by-frame clearing and redrawing for smooth animation

### Test Results
- ✅ Asteroid field generates consistently with proper material distribution
- ✅ Visual effects render correctly across all material types
- ✅ Performance stable with 8+ asteroids moving simultaneously
- ✅ No collision issues with ship movement through asteroid field
- ✅ Screen wrapping works seamlessly for all asteroids
- ✅ Debug system provides accurate real-time feedback

### Next Phase Preview
**Phase 3: Collision Detection & Interaction** - Enable ship/asteroid collision detection and basic mining mechanics

### Development Notes
- Asteroid class architecture is extensible for future features (health, breaking apart, special behaviors)
- Material system ready for resource collection and ship upgrade mechanics
- Visual effects system can easily accommodate more material types
- Physics bodies prepared for collision detection implementation

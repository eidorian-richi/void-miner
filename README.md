# Void Miner

A space mining adventure game inspired by classic Asteroids with modern progression mechanics. Navigate asteroid fields using physics-based movement, mine valuable materials, and upgrade your ship to explore deeper into the void.

## Game Concept

**Core Gameplay:**
- Physics-based ship movement (thrust and momentum like classic Asteroids)
- Mine different asteroid types for various materials (iron, crystals, rare metals)
- Use collected materials to upgrade ship capabilities
- Explore procedurally generated asteroid fields
- Encounter enemies protecting valuable asteroid clusters

**Visual Style:**
- Vector/geometric graphics with bright, colorful shapes
- Different colored geometric asteroids representing material types
- Scalable graphics optimized for mobile screens

**Target Audience:** Family-friendly game designed for ages 8-12

## Development Status

ðŸš€ **Phase 1 Complete** - Ship physics and controls fully implemented

**Current Phase:** Asteroid generation and collision detection

**Latest Milestone:** Successfully implemented physics-based ship movement with auto-stabilization system and visual effects

### Completed Features
- âœ… Physics-based ship movement with momentum and inertia
- âœ… Auto-stabilization system (automatic braking when thrust released)  
- âœ… Vector graphics ship and flame effects
- âœ… Screen edge wrapping
- âœ… Mobile-optimized scaling and responsive design
- âœ… Debug system for development

### Current Capabilities
- Fully controllable ship with realistic space physics
- Visual feedback for thrust and stabilization systems
- Clean, scalable vector graphics
- Professional development structure ready for expansion

## Technology Stack

- **Engine:** Phaser.js (JavaScript game framework)
- **Graphics:** Vector/geometric shapes (programmatically generated)
- **Platform:** Web-based with mobile optimization
- **Deployment:** Browser-based, Android-compatible

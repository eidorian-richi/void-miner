# Void Miner

A space mining adventure game inspired by classic Asteroids with modern progression mechanics. Navigate asteroid fields using physics-based movement, mine valuable materials, and upgrade your ship to explore deeper into the void.

## Game Concept

**Core Gameplay:**
- Physics-based ship movement (thrust and momentum like classic Asteroids)
- Mine different asteroid types for various materials (iron, crystals, rare metals)
- Use collected materials to upgrade ship capabilities
- Explore procedurally generated asteroid fields
- Encounter enemies protecting valuable asteroid clusters

**Visual Style:**
- Vector/geometric graphics with bright, colorful shapes
- Different colored geometric asteroids representing material types
- Scalable graphics optimized for mobile screens

**Target Audience:** Family-friendly game designed for ages 8-12

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - Setting up project structure and basic mechanics

**Current Phase:** Project initialization and development environment setup

## Technology Stack

- **Engine:** Phaser.js (JavaScript game framework)
- **Graphics:** Vector/geometric shapes (programmatically generated)
- **Platform:** Web-based with mobile optimization
- **Deployment:** Browser-based, Android-compatible
